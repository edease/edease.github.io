# Edease Test Website

## Website
https://edease.github.io/

Formatting of this website should be done entirely via the gpi_edease.css file in the GPI folder. The methods for achieving this goal are currently under developemnt. All client-side functionality is provided by GPI.js, which is loaded from the Glowinkowski site.
